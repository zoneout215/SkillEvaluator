SkillEvaluator is an open-source, multi-tier framework for evaluating AI agent
artifacts, starting with agent skills: deterministic quality gates, semantic
overlap detection, synthetic eval dataset generation, and live agent evaluation.

Agent skills extend AI agents with instructions and supporting files, as
defined by the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/).
SkillEvaluator is part of the
[NVIDIA Verified Skills pipeline](https://github.com/NVIDIA/skills).
Skills that pass are published to the
[NVIDIA skills catalog](https://github.com/NVIDIA/skills).

> **Research foundation.** Tier 3 implements methods from
> [*Evaluating Skills, Not Just Agents: Agentic Continuous Evaluation of Skills*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.20614):
> paired with/without-skill trials and Skill Lift; SkillEvaluator provides
> validation, deduplication, dataset authoring, and reporting.

## Three-tier overview

![SkillEvaluator three-tier pipeline: Skill → Tier 1 Validation → Tier 2 Deduplication → Tier 3 Live Evaluation → Reports](docs/assets/three-tier-overview.svg)

Run each tier independently.

| Tier | Purpose | Run one tier | Requires |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 1: Validation | Safe & well-formed? | `skillevaluator tier1 ./my-skill` | External scanners for full coverage; a provider enables rubric and LLM security checks |
| Tier 2: Deduplication | Repeated or overlapping guidance? | `skillevaluator tier2 ./my-skill` | Embeddings and chat; add `--catalog ./skill-catalog.json` for inter-skill comparison |
| Tier 3: Live Evaluation | Does it help the agent? | `skillevaluator tier3 ./my-skill` | Provider access, a supported agent, and a running sandbox (Docker by default) |

[SkillSpector](https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillSpector) provides Tier 1 security
scanning; [Harbor](https://github.com/harbor-framework/harbor), the open-source agent
evaluation framework, powers Tier 3 sandboxed agent runs.
See the [tier guides](https://docs.nvidia.com/skills/skillevaluator/).

## Quickstart

Install with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv tool install --python 3.13 "skillevaluator[all] @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillEvaluator.git"
```

**NVIDIA Build: set just two variables.** [API key](https://build.nvidia.com):

```bash
export SKILL_EVAL_LLM_PROVIDER=nv_build
export NVIDIA_API_KEY='nvapi-...'
```

This key covers chat, Tier 2 embeddings, and supported Tier 3 agents in
Docker or local mode.

For gateways, set `SKILL_EVAL_LLM_PROVIDER=openai-compatible`,
`SKILL_EVAL_LLM_BASE_URL`, and `SKILL_EVAL_LLM_API_KEY`.
[Model defaults are overridable](docs/configuration.mdx#choose-an-llm-provider);
the gateway must support the selected models and APIs.

Run all tiers on `./my-skill`, a directory containing `SKILL.md`:

```bash
skillevaluator validate ./my-skill
```

Run individual tiers:

```bash
skillevaluator tier1 ./my-skill
skillevaluator tier2 ./my-skill
skillevaluator tier3 ./my-skill
```

- **Tier 1** runs static checks, including dependency checks, plus rubric,
  LLM security analysis, and finding verification when a provider is configured.
  Without a provider, LLM stages are reported as skipped.
  Use `--no-llm` to opt out of LLM checks.
- **Tier 2** checks for repeated content inside the skill. Add
  `--catalog ./skill-catalog.json` to compare against other skills too; without
  a catalog, the output explicitly says inter-skill comparison did not run.
- **Tier 3** creates one starter evaluation case if no dataset or task source
  exists, then runs the provider-native agent in Docker with and without the
  skill. Valid existing sources are reused unchanged; invalid ones produce an
  error. Review starter cases; they provide limited coverage.

A tier without a path shows help.
Expert commands such as `tier1 security-scan`, `tier2 similarity-check`, and
`tier3 create-eval-dataset` remain available.

### Runtime requirements

`[all]` installs Python extras; full Tier 1 needs Semgrep, SkillSpector, and Gitleaks,
and Tier 3 needs an agent runtime and sandbox. Follow the
[installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/skills/skillevaluator/installation),
then check readiness:

```bash
skillevaluator doctor --env-mode docker
```

For a keyless check without external scanners, run
`skillevaluator quality-check ./my-skill`. If the command is unavailable,
run `uv tool update-shell` and reopen your terminal.

### Other providers and optional model overrides

OpenAI uses two variables and defaults to Codex for Tier 3:

```bash
export SKILL_EVAL_LLM_PROVIDER=openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
```

NVIDIA Build defaults to `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` for evaluator chat,
Tier 3 agent execution, and judging. Its embedding default is
`nvidia/nemotron-3-embed-1b`; OpenAI defaults to `gpt-5.6-sol` and
`text-embedding-3-small`. These are configured defaults, not automatically
updated selections of the latest models. To select a different evaluator model:

```bash
export SKILL_EVAL_LLM_MODEL='your-provider-model-id'
```

The standard judge inherits that model unless overridden. Tier 3 defaults:
NVIDIA Build=OpenCode, OpenAI=Codex, Anthropic=Claude Code (API key/OAuth).
Use `--agents` and `--agent-model` to override the agent and its model separately.

Anthropic and Bedrock need a separate embedding provider for Tier 2. Custom
OpenAI-compatible endpoints also require explicit endpoint and model settings.
See [Providers & Credentials](https://docs.nvidia.com/skills/skillevaluator/configuration)
for these setups and advanced overrides.

## Run the combined pipeline

`validate` runs Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 with autopilot by default for skills:

```bash
skillevaluator validate ./my-skill
```

`--full` remains supported but is unnecessary.
Use `--tiers 1,2` or `--no-tier3` to skip live evaluation; `--tiers 1` runs
only the static suite. `--no-autopilot` requires an existing evaluation source.
Rules, workflows, and plugins retain their applicable validation stages without
automatically enabling skill evaluation.

Generate and review broader coverage; templates omit negatives unless authored in `EVAL.md`:

```bash
skillevaluator tier3 create-eval-dataset ./my-skill --full
```

Tier 1 always gates `validate`. Tier 2 gates by default;
`--no-block-on-dedup` makes its findings advisory. Tier 3 is advisory by default;
`--block-on-agent-eval` makes its findings gate too. Live model calls and managed
sandboxes can incur charges; start with one agent and a small dataset. See the
[Tier 3 guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/skills/skillevaluator/tier3-live-evaluation#plan-for-cost)
for runtime and cost details.

## Run from a source checkout

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/SkillEvaluator.git
cd SkillEvaluator
uv sync --python 3.13 --extra all
uv run --extra all skillevaluator tier1 ./my-skill
```

Use the provider exports above. Prefix other commands with
`uv run --extra all` to select this checkout.
